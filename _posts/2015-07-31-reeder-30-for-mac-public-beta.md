My favorite applications to follow blogs and latest news, Reeder 3 for Mac now enters public beta. The most noticeable changes is now Reeder 3 bring flatter and blurry OS X Yosemite looks. If you living dangerously with installing OS X El Capitan just like me, Reeder 3 also supports the new San Francisco fonts.
