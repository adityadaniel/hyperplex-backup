We all know and admit that Chrome is [the most popular browser](http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp) in the world with approximately make 64.8% of internet visit. But there's not a secret anymore that Chrome has issues with its memory management. Chrome. It eats your RAM and memory of your laptop/ PC and that's why extensions such us [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg) and [OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall) exist to reduce this annoyances. 

I use Chrome at work and the memory management issue on Chrome is really bad. It's not just slowing Chrome itself but the entire computer and sometimes make other program not responding when I open too many tabs[^fn1]. Since I use it on PC, there's no problem with battery usage[^fn2] but when you use it on PC or Mac you should think about it.

[BatteryBox recently published](http://blog.getbatterybox.com/which-browser-is-the-most-energy-efficient-chrome-vs-safari-vs-firefox/) numbers from their experiment comparing power consumption of three major browser, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome on Macbook. The result, Safari is the most efficient than other two with average 6 hours and 21 minutes of total usage. Chrome, of course, gets on the third place with just 5 hours 8 min of total usage when you use it on Mac.

Not a surprise.

From [MacSparky](http://macsparky.com/):

> Clearly, preserving battery life on all of its devices is a high priority for Apple. I'd venture to say that because Apple is the hardware vendor, preserving battery life always will be higher on Apple's list than Google's.

[^fn1]: Less than 20 if it's not too many

[^fn2]: Obviously
